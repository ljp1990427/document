The combinatorial optimization is one of the hottest topics which
aims to search for an optimal solution among a finite solution space.
Most conventional methods such as exhaustive search is not a proper
approach for it.
S. Kirkpatrick et al. find that there existing a close relationship
between the statistical mechanics and the combinatorial optimization.
Based on this finding, they propose the simulated annealing algorithm
as a promising approach for the combinatorial optimization in
\cite{10.2307/1690046}.
They introduce the metropolis criterion and explain how it can be
applied to improve the solution quality provided by local search
algorithm. In this article, the simulated annealing process is
developed to consist of a parameterized framework which is already
discussed in Section \ref{subsec:simulated_annealing}. To illustrate
the usability of the simulated annealing, S. Kirkpatrick et al. deploy
the algorithm in the physical design of computers to optimize the
circuits partitioning, placement and wiring processes.
In addition, they also apply the simulated annealing to the classical
traveling salesmen problem. Multiple experiments of above optimization
problem are conducted in this article and the experiment results are
used to show good solutions can be obtained by the usage of the
simulated annealing algorithm. It is pointed out by S. Kirkpatrick et al.
that the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are much dependent on
its parameters. However, no details about the parameter configuration are
represented in \cite{10.2307/1690046} except some brief suggestions.
