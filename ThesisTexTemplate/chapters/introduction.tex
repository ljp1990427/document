\label{chap:introduction}
	Nowadays in the field of embedded systems design , power consumption has become one of the most important design factors especially in the domain of Systems-on-Chip. One of the important issues to design power-efficient embedded system is the power consumed by memories and memory related components. Some researchers have claimed that large fraction of power is dissipated by memories \cite{876761, 4415607}. Thus, memory power optimization plays a significant role in the design of power-efficient embedded systems.
	One of the most effective and common approaches to reduce memory power consumption is the memory partitioning method which is proposed in several articles and books \cite[p.43]{876761, Hiser:2005:EAP:1088093, macii2002memory}.
	The rationale of memory partitioning is , on the one hand, to split one single large memory into several small memory instances which can be accessed individually \cite{4415607}. On the other hand, according to the memory access patterns, frequently accessed address ranges are grouped to smaller memory instances while seldom accessed address ranges are grouped to the larger ones \cite{Strobel2016}.
	The memory power reduction is one of the combinatorial optimizations since the process is to find the optimal memory configuration from a set of memories and applications. There are many algorithms that can be applied in the domain of combinatorial optimization. One approach is the integer linear programming (ILP) which solves the optimization problem through a mathematical model described by certain integer linear relationship. This approach is proposed in \cite{Strobel2016} for the memory power optimization.
	Another commonly deployed approach is the heuristic algorithm which is based on searching mechanisms. Many classical combinatorial optimization
	problems such as traveling sales man (TSP) problem have been solved by using heuristic algorithms.
	
	When solving a optimization problem with a very large solution space, the algorithms used to find the exact optimal solution may be ideal. However, the computation time of such algorithms may not be acceptable in practice. Even in some problem sets, the exact optimal solution can not be found by the conventional algorithms. In such cases, the user of heuristics can find a near optimal solution within a reasonable
	time. Though the solution provided by heuristics may not be the exact optimal one, it still can be considered as a valuable solution of the optimization problem. One key feature of heuristics is the trade-off between algorithm efficiency and precision. The solution quality and the computation time can be balanced by users according to their different requirements.
	
	The goal of this thesis work is to apply heuristics for the purpose of the memory power reduction. The targeted problem set is the same
	optimization problem used in \cite{Strobel2016}.
	Firstly, multiple potential heuristics are theoretical examined and the most promising algorithm is identified and proposed for the optimization objective.
	Secondly, the selected heuristic is adapted to a formal power model which is defined in \cite{Strobel2016}.
	Then the framework of the chosen algorithm along with its parameters are realized for the power model.
	Lastly, the evaluation of the implemented heuristic is performed. The optimal solutions found by the chosen algorithm are compared with the
	obtained results in \cite{Strobel2016}.
	
	The structure of this document is organized as follows.
	Chapter \ref{chap:basics} introduces the basic knowledge of the memory partitioning method. Also in Chapter \ref{chap:basics}, some potential heuristics are discussed and the simulated annealing algorithm is selected for the memory power optimization.
	Chapter \ref{chap:related_work} discusses the related works for memory partitioning and simulated annealing algorithm.
	Chapter \ref{chap:main_work} represents the design details of the simulated annealing for memory power optimization.
	The evaluation of the simulated annealing algorithm results is given in Chapter \ref{chap:evaluation}.
	And Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} concludes this thesis work.
